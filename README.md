Platform-agnostic driver to communicate with devices that implement the [Adafruit Seesaw firmware.](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Seesaw) See the Seesaw [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-seesaw-atsamd09-breakout) for more information on the firmware.

# Introduction

The library uses and follows the patterns of the [`shared-bus`](https://github.com/Rahix/shared-bus) library so that multiple devices can be connected and communicated with without owning the I2C bus.

Communicating with Seesaw devices requires a bus that implements both `I2C` traits and `Delay` from `embedded-hal`.

# Using within a single thread

If you're communicating with devices within a single thread, use the `SeesawSingleThread` struct, which uses the `NullMutex` bus mutex implementation from `shared-bus:

```rs
// Setup on an STM32F405
let cp = cortex_m::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let clocks = dp.RCC.constrain().cfgr.freeze();
let delay = cp.SYST.delay(&clocks);
let i2c = I2c::new(dp.I2C1, (scl, sda), 400.kHz(), &clocks);
let seesaw = SeesawSingleThread::new(delay, i2c);
```

# Using across multiple threads

[WIP] Pending implementation of `Seesaw` for other `BusMutex` types.

# Creating a Device

All devices implement the `SeesawDevice` trait and have the same constructor function, along with lots of other device-specific information.

| Product value   | Const method on all `SeesawDevice`s | Notes                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default Address | `Device::default_addr()`            |
| Hardware ID     | `Device::hardware_id()`             | This value depends on the host MCU of the device                                       |
| Product ID      | `Device::product_id()`              | You can use this value to go to the product page at `adafruit.com/product/$product_id` |

Let's talk to a [NeoKey1x4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4980) using the `seesaw` manager we created above.

### Using the default address

```rs
let neokeys = NeoKey1x4::new_with_default_addr(seesaw.acquire_driver());
```

### Using a custom address

```rs
let neokeys = NeoKey1x4::new(0x00, seesaw.acquire_driver());
```

# Initializing Devices

Devices that implement `SeesawDevice` also implmement `SeesawDeviceInit`, which defines a device-specific `init` function for setting up a device's hardware functionality. The intention is to run a set of sensible defaults so you don't have to remember to do it yourself.

```rs
let neokeys = NeoKey1x4::new_with_default_addr(seesaw.acquire_driver())
    .init()
    .expect("Failed to initialize NeoKey1x4");
```

For instance, the `init` function for our `Neokey1x4` does the following:

- Resets the device
- Reads & verifies the device hardware ID
- Enables the on-device neopixels
- Enables the on-device buttons

Calling `init` is of course optional, but without it you'll have to handle initialization yourself.

# Creating Your Own Devices

So far, this library only implements a few Seesaw devices (i.e., the ones that I currently own). You can define your own device using the `seesaw_device!` macro.

Let's assume you have some future Adafruit Neokey-esque device that has 6 buttons and 6 neopixels.

```rs
seesaw_device! {
    name: Neokey2x3,
    hardware_id: HardwareId::_,
    product_id: _,
    default_addr: _,
    modules: [
        GpioModule,
        NeopixelModule { num_leds: 6, pin: _ },
    ]
}
```

The last thing you might want to do is implmeent the `SeesawDeviceInit` trait to handle the device intialization:

```rs
impl<D: Driver> SeesawDeviceInit<D> for Neokey2x3<D> {
    fn init(mut self) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        self.reset_and_verify_seesaw()
            .and_then(|_| self.enable_neopixel())
            .and_then(|_| self.enable_button_pins())
            .map(|_| self)
    }
}
```

Now you can use the new device as you would any other:

```rs
let neokeys = NeoKey2x3::new_with_default_addr(seesaw.acquire_driver())
    .init()
    .expect("Failed to initialize NeoKey1x4");
```
